Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the government's $1.5-billion ocean protection plan in Vancouver today for responses to tanker and fuel spills in the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans.

Trudeau said the funding over five years will include creating a marine safety system, restoring marine ecosystems and research into oil spill cleanup methods.

He called it "the most significant investment ever made to protect our oceans and coastlines."
